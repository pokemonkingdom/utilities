# Contribution
- Make sure there aren't any duplicate issues opened before opening one
- You're free to open a pull request if you think it is needed, but please try to format any code in a similar way that's being done in the rest of the project before doing so.

### Translation
If you want to contribute with a translation, duplicate the [src/locales/en.json](src/locales/en.json) file.

- The translated json file should be named like `<>.json` with the ISO language code being used and placed inside the directory [src/locales/](src/locales/), for example: `pt-br.json`.
- Before translating, check if the locale is listed [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#locales). If it's not, we can't use it unfortunately...
